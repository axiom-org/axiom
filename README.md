# Axiom
The best way to build a decentralized application.

## What is this

The READMEs in this repository are designed to be useful to people who are contributing
to the source code of the Axiom platform itself.

If you are interested in building an application that uses Axiom, rather than contributing
to Axiom itself, you should check out [the main documentation](https://axiom.org/docs).

## Code organization

* `api`: The core Axiom code
* `cli`: The command line interface
* `ops`: Tools for deploying stuff
